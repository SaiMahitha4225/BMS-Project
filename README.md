Online Book Store


# About Project:
Online Book Store project exemplifies the synergy of Java Full Stack technology. Java provides a robust backend, Spring Boot simplifies development tasks, Angular crafts an interactive frontend, and MySQL manages the essential data. This amalgamation of technologies results in a powerful and user-friendly platform for browsing, selecting, and purchasing books online.

# OVERVIEW :
The Online Book Store project is a sophisticated web-based application designed to facilitate users in browsing and acquiring books through digital means. This application harnesses the power of Java Full Stack technology, a comprehensive framework that incorporates a range of tools and technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL.
Java, a robust and versatile programming language, serves as the foundation of this project. Its object-oriented nature allows developers to create efficient and modular code, making it an ideal choice for building complex applications.
The Spring Boot framework is employed to streamline the development process. Spring Boot's integration with other Spring projects helps developers focus on building the application's logic rather than dealing with infrastructure concerns.
Angular, a popular front-end framework, is utilized to construct the user interface of the Online Book Store. Angular's component-based architecture enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web pages, ensuring an engaging user experience.
MySQL, a well-established relational database management system, is chosen to manage and store the application's data. It provides a structured and organized way to store information about books, users, orders, and other relevant details. 

# FEATURES OF THE PROJECT :
User Registration and Login: Users can create new accounts by registering with their email addresses and providing a password. Once registered, users can log in securely using their credentials. The registration and login process involves:Input validation to ensure accurate and secure information. Password encryption to safeguard user data. Session management to keep users logged in during their browsing and shopping sessions.
Book Browsing and Searching: The application allows users to explore the book catalog through various methods, including:Browsing books by categories such as genres .Searching books by title, author, or keywords. Displaying book details such as title, author, description, cover image, and price .Pagination to handle a large number of books effectively.
Shopping Cart and Checkout Process: Users can add books to their shopping carts and proceed to the checkout process to finalize their purchases. This involves:Adding and removing books from the cart .Displaying the selected books along with their quantities and total prices .Calculating the subtotal, taxes, and total order amount .Capturing shipping and billing information. Integrating with payment gateways for secure payment processing. Generating order confirmations and providing order history for users. 
SOFTWARE USED FOR THE PROJECT:
•Java
•Spring Book
•MySQL

# CHALLENGES :
•Integrating the front-end and back-end components
 *Integrating the front-end and back-end components is a critical step in building a functional and cohesive web application like the Online Book Store.
 Define API Endpoints
 Angular Services
 HTTP Requests
•Ensuring data security and privacy
 *Ensuring data security and privacy is of paramount importance in any application, especially in an Online Book Store where sensitive user information and payment details are involved.
 Use HTTPS
 Authentication and Authorization
 Input Validation and Sanitization

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 •Integration with payment gateways for secure online transactions
 •Implementation of a recommendation engine based on user browsing and purchase history.
SURVEY:
We conducted an online survey and we got 93 responses ,by considering this survey we will develop our project further.

# Conclusion :
An online book store is a web application that allows customers to buy books online. Customers can search for a book by title or author using a web browser, add it to their shopping cart, and then purchase it using a debit or credit card transaction.
